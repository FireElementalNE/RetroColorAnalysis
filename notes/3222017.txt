Clustering games by color metrics:
	- Look to https://gamecip.soe.ucsc.edu/projects!
	- use multiple metrics to cluster games in an n-dimensional space

House Keeping:
	- Clean up code
	- add more comments
	- use existing code as a component to larger code base

PS-NOTE:

	- ADD 3D plot for RGB HSV and LAB points
